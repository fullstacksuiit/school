							<p>Administrators, unlike teachers, work a twelve-month year and are fairly busy most of that time. Whether running a small, private day-care center or an overcrowded public high school, an administrator’s tasks are many and various, ranging from curriculum development to student discipline. The most familiar school administrator is the principal. Assisting the principal are vice-principals, whose duties tend to be more specialized and who have more responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the school.</p>

							<h5><a href="#"><i class="icon-book"></i>Communication</a> (05)</h5>
							<p>Throughout your child’s school years, there is always a need to communicate with the school’s teachers, administrators, and others concerned with your child’s education. There are also times when the school needs to communicate with you. This is particularly true when your child has a disability and is receiving special education services. Some of this communication is informal, such as phone calls, comments in your child’s notebook, a chat when picking your child up from school or at a school function.</p>

                <p>In every school the most exciting activity is the annual school sports. It is held once a year, around the month of December. The winter afternoon is the ideal time for having school sports. Our school is quite famous for its sports. Last year our annual school sports day was organized on 15 December. It was conducted for two days. The first day was the junior sports day from class 1 to 5. The second day was for the senior boys from classes 6 to 12. It was held in our school play ground.</p>

                <p>Variety is the spice of life. Life without feasts and celebrations is charm less and lifeless. So is true in case of school life. Without functions and celebrations school life becomes monotonous and uninteresting. Therefore, almost all the schools have certain annual functions such as, Annual Sports Day, Parents’ Day, Teacher’s Day, School Anniversary Day, etc. These celebrations add colour and charm to school life.
Recently my school celebrated our Annual Parents Day with great pomp and show. The Parents’ Day celebration is the most important function in my school. A lot of preparation precedes the function. The main purpose of this function is to thank and appreciate the parents and the guardians of children, who help the school authorities in the process of education. </p>

It is one of the four sacred months of the year.[1] It is held to be the holiest month, Ramadan coming after. The word "Muharram" means "forbidden". Since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, Muharram moves from year to year when compared with the Gregorian calendar.

The tenth day of Muharram is the Day of Ashura, which to Shia Muslims is part of the Mourning of Muharram. Sunni Muslims fast during this day, because it is recorded in the hadith[2] that Musa (Moses) and his people obtained a victory over the Egyptian Pharaoh on the 10th day of Muharram; accordingly Muhammad asked Muslims to fast on this day that is Ashura and on a day before that is 9th (called Tasu'a).</p>
